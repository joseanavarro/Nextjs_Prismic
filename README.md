## The idea behind the example

This is very simple example that uses Next.js + Prismic as data source.

The aim of this demo is to show how data is retrieved from Prismic backend and show in console log where the calls to backend are done
--> Open console in server and client and load page --> You will see the call to prismic in server side console
--> Click a link in the rendered page --> You will see the call to prismic in the cliente side console
--> Reload the page with one of the articles --> You will see the call to prismic in server side console
